                <p>This map plots all the schools affected by RAAC (Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete) in the UK. It was created by <a href="https://jonnowitts.com">Jonno Witts</a>.</p>
                <p>It's still a work in progress.</p>
                <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@jonnowitts.com">send me an email</a> if you have any questions.</p>

            <div class="copy">
                <p>Data has been collected from various sources, primarily the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reinforced-autoclaved-aerated-concrete-raac-management-information">UK Government's official list</a>. In order to plot the points onto the map postcodes were converted to longitude and latitudes and gathered (by hand!) from <a href="https://uprn.uk/">UPRN.uk</a>. Further data about each school was collected from the <a href="https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/Downloads">Department for Education's full list of schools in the UK</a> (this coming soon).</p>
                <p>All of the data used and gathered can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/jonnow/raac-schools/tree/main/public/data">data folder on GitHub</a>.</p>
